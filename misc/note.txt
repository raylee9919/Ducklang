Expression Problem: Row vs Column major?
                    OOP vs FP
                    Type vs Operator major?
                    'Crafting Interpreters' uses 'Visitor Pattern' to resolve.


'Precedance' and 'Associativity' are for resolving 'Ambiguity'.

    1. Prefix Expressions
    e.g. If expression starts with '(', we know we must be looking at a 
         parenthesized grouping expression. '(', '!' , '-'

    2. Infix Expressions
